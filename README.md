# CleanArchitecture with Koin

Implementation of Clean Architecture and Koin library

## Layers of Clean Architecture

Clean architecture is also referred to as Onion architecture as it has different layers. As per our requirement, we need to define the layers, however, architecture doesnâ€™t specify the number of layers.
For a basic idea, let us consider there are 3 layers for now:

### App Layer
MainActivity & WeatherViewModel : This layer that interacts with the UI.

### Domain Layer
WeatherModel : Contains the business logic of the application. It is the individual and innermost module.

### Interactor 
GetWeatherDataUseCaseImpl & GetWeatherDataUseCase : Mediator between App layer and data layer.

### Data Layer
WeatherRepository, WeatherDataSourceImpl & WeatherDataSource : It includes the domain layer. It would implement the interface exposed by domain layer.
